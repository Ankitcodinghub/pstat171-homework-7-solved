1. At the beginning of a quarter, Bridget Dubois purchases 200 shares of preferred stock for aprice to provide her with a yield rate equal to 6.2%. Assuming the stipulated dividends of $ .28 per share are paid quarterly, what is Bridgetâ€™s per share price?

4. Gregory sells a stock short at a price P and buys it back one year later for .9P. The required margin is 50% and interest on the margin deposit is paid at 5%. Gregoryâ€™s yield for the year is 14%. Dividends are paid out at the end of the year. Find the amount of these dividends as a percent of Gregoryâ€™s investment.

5. Warren sells short $3,000 of a common stock that pays dividends of $20 after six months and $15 after eighteen months. The margin requirement is 50%, and the annual effective interest rate on the margin account is 4%. Twenty months after he sold the stock, Warren repurchases the stock (to cover the short sale) for $ 2,650. Find his annual yield for this twenty-month investment.

(b) What must be the price of marginable securities added to satisfy the 40% margin requirement?Assume no cash is added or stock sold.

(c) If the margin requirement is to be satisfied solely by liquidation of stocks, what is the marketvalue of the stocks that must be sold?
